<objective>
Verify Phase 5 implementation compiles correctly and all new types are accessible in editor.

Purpose: Ensure all Phase 5 additions integrate properly with the existing vehicle system and are ready for use.
Output: Compilation verification and editor accessibility confirmation.

  <name>Task 1: Verify Plugin Compilation</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Verify the GSD_Vehicles plugin compiles with all Phase 5 additions:

1. Run UnrealBuildTool to compile the GSD_Vehicles module
2. Check for any compilation errors or warnings
3. Verify all new headers are properly included in the build

The plugin should compile without errors after all Phase 5 plans are executed.

No code changes needed - this is a verification-only task.

Phase 5 Vehicle Advanced Features:

1. **Data Assets:**
   - GSDLaunchControlConfig - Throttle ramp and traction control settings
   - GSDTuningPreset - Steering, suspension, tire, engine, physics multipliers
   - GSDAttachmentConfig - Socket-based attachment definitions

2. **Subsystem:**
   - GSDVehiclePoolSubsystem - Vehicle pooling with physics reset

3. **Components:**
   - GSDLaunchControlComponent - Launch control logic
   - GSDAttachmentComponent - Socket-based attachment management

4. **Vehicle Extensions:**
   - GSDVehicleConfig extended with LaunchControlConfig, TuningPresets, Attachments
   - GSDVehiclePawn extended with components and ApplyTuningPreset()
   - GSDVehicleSpawnerSubsystem extended with pooling methods

5. **Testbed:**
   - GSDVehicleTestbedActor - 50 vehicle spawn with FPS tracking
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open the Unreal Editor with the GSD_Vehicles plugin
2. Open Edit > Plugins and verify GSD_Vehicles is enabled
3. Create a new Data Asset:
   - Right-click in Content Browser > Miscellaneous > Data Asset
   - Verify GSDLaunchControlConfig, GSDTuningPreset, GSDAttachmentConfig appear in list
4. Check Blueprint accessibility:
   - Create a new Blueprint Class
   - Search for "GSDLaunchControlComponent" - should appear
   - Search for "GSDAttachmentComponent" - should appear
   - Search for "GSDVehicleTestbedActor" - should appear as placeable actor
5. Verify vehicle config extension:
   - Create/open a GSDVehicleConfig Data Asset
   - Verify "Advanced Features" category appears with:
     - Launch Control Config
     - Tuning Presets
     - Available Attachments
     - Default Attachments
6. Optional: Place GSDVehicleTestbedActor in a level and test spawning
